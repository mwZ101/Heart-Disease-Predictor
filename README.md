# Heart Disease Predictor

The goal of this project is to apply machine learning algorithms to a dataset to predict whether someone has heart disease. The algorithms that were used include logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest. 

There are two scripts for this project: one for plotting the data from the dataset to find any trends and one for applying the machine learning algorithms to a training and test set split of the dataset.
